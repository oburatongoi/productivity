  "readme": "# hullabaloo-config-manager\n\nManages complex [Babel] config chains, avoiding duplicated work and enabling\neffective caching.\n\n> Hullabaloo: informal of \"babel\" (noun)\n>\n> A confused noise, typically that made by a number\nof voices: *the babel of voices on the road.*\n\nUse this package to resolve [Babel] config chains. The resulting options result\nin equivalent compilation behavior as if `babel-core` had resolved the config.\n\nA Node.js-compatible JavaScript module can be generated which exports a function\nthat provides the options object, applicable for the current environment. This\nmodule can be written to disk and reused.\n\nConfig sources and plugin and preset dependencies can be hashed and used as\ncache keys. The cache keys and generated module can be verified to avoid having\nto repeatedly resolve the config chains, and to be sure a previously\ntransformation result can be reused.\n\nThis module is used by [AVA].\n\n## Installation\n\n```console\n$ npm install --save hullabaloo-config-manager\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst configManager = require('hullabaloo-config-manager')\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `currentEnv(): string`\n\nReturns the current environment value, just like `babel-core` would determine\nit.\n\n### `fromDirectory(dir: string, options?: {cache: Cache}): Promise<null | ResolvedConfig>`\n\nAsynchronously resolves config chains from the `dir` directory. If no config can\nbe found the promise is resolved with `null`. Otherwise it is resolved with the\n[resulting config object](#resolvedconfig). The promise is rejected if\n[errors](#errors) occur.\n\nA `cache` object may be provided.\n\n### `createConfig(options: {options: BabelOptions, source: string, dir?: string, hash?: string, json5?: false}): Config`\n\nCreates and returns an in-memory [config object](#config). The first argument\nmust be provided, and it must have a valid [`options` object](#babeloptions) and\n`source` value.\n\nIf the `dir` value is not provided it's derived from the `source` value.\nDependencies are resolved relative to this `dir`.\n\nIf the config source does not exist on disk the `hash` value should be provided,\notherwise hashes cannot be created for the config.\n\nThe `json5` property can be set to `false` if the `options` object can be\nserialized using `JSON.stringify()`.\n\nNote that the `options` object is cloned (deeply) before use.\n\n### `fromConfig(baseConfig: Config, options?: {cache: Cache}): Promise<ResolvedConfig>`\n\nAsynchronously resolves config chains, starting with the `baseConfig`. The\n`baseConfig` must be created using the `createConfig()` method. The promise is\nresolved with the [resulting config object](#resolvedconfig). The promise is\nrejected if [errors](#errors) occur.\n\nA `cache` object may be provided.\n\n### `restoreVerifier(buffer: Buffer): Verifier`\n\nDeserializes a [`Verifier`](#verifier). The `buffer` should be created using\n`Verifier#toBuffer()`.\n\n### `prepareCache(): Cache`\n\nCreates a cache object that can be passed to the above functions. This may\nimprove performance by avoiding repeatedly reading files from disk or computing\nhashes.\n\n---\n\n### `Config`\n\nUse `createConfig()` to create this object.\n\n#### `Config#extend(config: Config)`\n\nExtend the config with another config. Throws a `TypeError` if the config was\ncreated with an `extends` clause in its `options`. It throws an `Error` if it\nhas already been extended.\n\n---\n\n### `BabelOptions`\n\nSee <https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/api/#options>.\n\n---\n\n### `ResolvedConfig`\n\nReturned by `fromConfig()` and `fromDirectory()`.\n\n#### `ResolvedConfig#generateModule(): string`\n\nGenerates a Node.js-compatible JavaScript module which exports a `getOptions()`\nfunction. This function returns a unique options object, applicable for the\ncurrent environment, that can be passed to `babel-core` methods.\n\nThis module needs to evaluated before the `getOptions()` method can be accessed.\n\n#### `ResolvedConfig#createVerifier(): Promise<Verifier>`\n\nAsynchronously hashes plugin and preset dependencies of the resolved config, as\nwell as config sources, and resolves the promise with a [`Verifier`](#verifier)\nobject.\n\n---\n\n### `Verifier`\n\nUse `restoreVerifier()` or `ResolvedConfig#createVerifier()` to create this\nobject.\n\n#### `Verifier#cacheKeysForCurrentEnv(): {dependencies: string, sources: string}`\n\nSynchronously returns cache keys for the plugin and preset dependencies, and\nconfig sources, that are applicable to the current environment. Use these values\nto cache the result of `babel-core` transforms.\n\n#### `Verifier#verifyCurrentEnv(fixedHashes?: {sources: {[source: string]: string}}, cache?: Cache): Promise<{badDependency: true} | {missingSource: true} | {sourcesChanged: true} |  {cacheKeys: {dependencies: string, sources: string}, dependenciesChanged: boolean, sourcesChanged: false, verifier: Verifier}>`\n\nAsynchronously verifies whether the config is still valid for the current\nenvironment.\n\nProvide `fixedHashes` if the verifier was derived from a created config with a\nfixed `hash` value. A `cache` object may also be provided.\n\nThe promise is resolved with an object describing the verification result:\n\n* If the object has a `badDependency` property then a plugin or preset\ndependency could not be hashed, presumably because it no longer exists.\n\n* If it has a `missingSource` property then a config source no longer exists.\n\n* If its `sourcesChanged` property is `true` then config sources have changed\nand the config is no longer valid.\n\n* If its `dependenciesChanged` property is `true` then plugin or preset\ndependencies have changed, but the config itself is still valid. The `verifier`\nproperty holds a new `Verifier` object which takes the new dependencies into\naccount. The `cacheKeys` property contains the same result as calling\n`Verifier#cacheKeysForCurrentEnv()` on the returned `verifier`.\n\n* If its `sourcesChanged` and `dependenciesChanged` properties are both `false`\nthen the config is valid and cache keys won't have changed. The `verifier`\nproperty holds the same `Verifier` object. The `cacheKeys` properties contains\nthe same result as calling `Verifier#cacheKeysForCurrentEnv()`.\n\n#### `Verifier#toBuffer()`\n\nSerializes the verifier state into a `Buffer` object. Use `restoreVerifier()`\nto deserialize.\n\n---\n\n### Errors\n\nError constructors are not publicly available, but errors can be identified by\ntheir `name` property.\n\n#### `BadDependencyError`\n\nUsed when a plugin or preset dependency couldn't be resolved. The corresponding\npackage or file name is available through the `source` property. There may be\nanother error with more details, available through the `parent` property.\n\n#### `ExtendsError`\n\nUsed when an `extends` clause points at a non-existent file. The config file\nthat contains the clause is available through the `source` property. The clause\nitself is available through the `clause` property. Has a `parent` property that\ncontains a `NoSourceFile` error.\n\n#### `InvalidFileError`\n\nUsed when a config file is invalid. The file path is available through the\n`source` property.\n\n#### `NoSourceFileError`\n\nUsed when a file does not exist. The file path is available through the `source`\nproperty.\n\n#### `ParseError`\n\nUsed when a config file cannot be parsed (this is different from it being\ninvalid). The file path is available through the `source` property. The parsing\nerror is available through the `parent` property.\n\n[AVA]: https://ava.li/\n[Babel]: https://babeljs.io/\n",
