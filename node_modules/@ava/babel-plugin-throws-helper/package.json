Now I'm beginning to see it with AVA too, so would be nice to be preemptive about it.\n>\n> People don't realize they need to wrap their call in a function, so many end up doing `t.throws(foo())` instead of `t.throws(() => foo());`. It's an easy mistake to make.\n\nThe difficulty is that `t.throws(foo())` is allowed if `foo()` returns a promise or a function. There is no good way to differentiate between the two at runtime. So providing a good error message is going to take some AST transform magic.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nSee [`example-output.md`](example-output.md) for the transformation this plugin performs.\n\nThe example output can be generated by calling:\n\n```\n$ WRITE_EXAMPLES=1 ava\n```\n\nContributors should not commit new examples. They will be regenerated as part of the release process.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [James Talmage](https://github.com/jamestalmage)\n",
